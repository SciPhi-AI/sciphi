        - To demonstrate your in-depth understanding of the frontier theories, experimental techniques and statistical analysis methods, as well as to stimulate your creativity in design and planning, each student in 8.811 is required to write a term research paper, and furthermore to present it, near the end of the semester, to the class for 35 minutes, including discussions. The written reports are officially due in my office. If you have extraordinary difficulty, you are urged to arrange with me individually.
