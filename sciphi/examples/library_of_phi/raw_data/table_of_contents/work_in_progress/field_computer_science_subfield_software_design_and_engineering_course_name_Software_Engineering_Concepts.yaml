In this updated version of the syllabus, the course is accompanied by a textbook called "Software Engineering: Principles and Practices". The original topics are now represented as chapters in the textbook, and the subtopics are represented as sections within each chapter. Additionally, a new key called "subsubtopics" is introduced to provide further granularity in content organization.
