        - Information:
          - We can remember the past efficiently
          - When data has more than one dimension
          - Is there one binary search tree that’s as good as all others? We still
            don’t know, but we’re close.
          - Real computers have multiple levels of caches. We can optimize the number
            of cache misses, often without even knowing the size of the cache.
          - Hashing is the most used data structure in computer science. And it’s
            still an active area of research.
          - Logarithmic time is too easy. By careful analysis of the information you’re
            dealing with, you can often reduce the operation times substantially,
            sometimes even to constant. We will also cover lower bounds that illustrate
            when this is not possible.
          - A network link went down, or you just added or deleted a friend in a social
            network. We can still maintain essential information about the connectivity
            as it changes.
          - Searching for phrases in giant text
          - Most 'linear size' data structures you know are much larger than they
            need to be, often by an order of magnitude. Some data structures require
            almost no space beyond the raw data but are still fast
