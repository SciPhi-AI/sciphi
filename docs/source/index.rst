SciPhi is a powerful knowledge engine tailored for LLM-based inference, data generation and management.

With SciPhi, you can:

* Tap into the **Retriever-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for data anchoring to real-world sources.
   - Features like end-to-end cloud and local RAG knowledge engine APIs are underway!
* Generate truthful datasets using various LLMs, supporting **Anthropic**, **OpenAI**, **vLLM**, and **SciPhi**.
* Custom tailor your data creation for applications such as LLM training, RAG, and beyond.
   - For ex., generate RAG-grounded textbooks from a given table of contents.

Quick and easy setup:

* Installation with pip: ``pip install sciphi``
* Optional dependencies are available for extended functionality, such as ``sciphi[vllm_support]`` for vLLM integration.

Diverse Features:

* Seamlessly integrate multiple LLM and RAG providers like SciPhi, OpenAI, Anthropic, HuggingFace, and vLLM.
* Generate custom datasets and even full textbooks using SciPhi's unique capabilities.
* Evaluate your RAG systems effectively with the SciPhi evaluation harness.
* Engage with the community on platforms like `Discord <https://discord.gg/j9GxfbxqAe>`_.

Developers can also instantiate their own LLM and RAG providers using the SciPhi framework. The supported LLM providers include popular choices like OpenAI, Anthropic, HuggingFace, and vLLM. For specialized RAG capabilities, SciPhi offers the `World Databasef API <https://sciphi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/main.html>`_ for comprehensive knowledge access.

You can use this format in your reStructuredText documentation, and it should render as a clickable link.
